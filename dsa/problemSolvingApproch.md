 1. Understanding the problem
  -restate the problem in own words
  -what are the input and outputs
  -Is there enough information to solve the
     problem
  -Thinking of labelling data( don't use random label like i, j, k, a, b)
  -checking the example with invalid, empty input
 2.Note own the details like input , output, outcome
 3.Start with the naive/brute force approch. First this that comes into mind. 
   It shows that you're able to think well and critically(you don't need to *   write this code, just speak about it.) 

4. Tell them why this approach is not the best (i.e. O(n^2)) or higher, not readable, etc.
5. Walk through your approach, comment things ans see where you may be able to break to follo
6. breakdonwn the steps and comment is the ultimate key, Rundown of thinking process, steps, Breaking down the code will you give you the extra advantage
7. before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follo .
8. start coding (simplify as necessary)
9. Can you write it better in terms of readability , time, space complexity?
10. If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here. It is also Common that the interviewer asks you extension question.
